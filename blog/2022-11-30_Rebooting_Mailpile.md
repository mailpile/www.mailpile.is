Long time no blog!

There have been a few updates on the
[the Community Forum](https://community.mailpile.is/),
but nothing here for quite a while!

This is a short post to update everyone on the current status of the project:

   1. The Mailpile v1 codebase is no longer being updated
   2. Mailpile v2 is making progress, in semi-stealth mode
   3. In parallel, a project to create a dedicated hardware device for Mailpile is underway

The mean reason for these changes,
is that Python 2 is no longer maintained or supported by the community,
and I decided that rewriting the whole thing in Python 3 made more sense than attempting to port the old code.

The old code remains a useful resource,
both for inspiration and sometimes for copying code directly over,
but enough things are new that it's most accurate to call Mailpile v2 a new application.
The code-name for the v2 project is *moggie*.

It's going well,
but I haven't made any public releases yet.

Watch this space for further updates.
Thanks for reading!
