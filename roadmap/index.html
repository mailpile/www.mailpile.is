This may also be a potential source of revenue for the project and a way to fund ongoing development, depending on what sort of agreements are made.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1125">see details</a></li>

Mailpile should work with these projects both on technical and potentially business fronts, as their goals are strongly aligned with ours and the technology complementary.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1126">see details</a></li>

Although Mailpile's built-in spam filter provides a degree of protection against these threats, further steps are necessary, many of which are outlined in our security roadmap.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1132">see details</a></li>

This covers everything from context-sensitive hints within the app itself, to long-form manuals, to video tutorials, to the website presenting Mailpile to the world. In addition, the most critical parts of the end-user documentation will need to be translated to multiple languages. The core team will not be able to do all of this work ourselves, but we need to be sure infrastructure is in place to work with our community on this important task and it might be worth spending a portion of our budget on hiring tech writers, editors or translators.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1130">see details</a></li>

The project should be expanded so Mailpile can be used in shared-hosting and multiuser environments, such as small to medium businesses and organizations. This will further our mission to bring user-friendly encryption to a wider audience, and make the project more sustainable as larger organizations become motivated to contribute resources to the development and upkeep of Mailpile.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/820">see details</a></li>

This is an important part of making Mailpile less dependent on the core team in the long-run, while making it easy for our wider community to add features that are tailored to their specific e-mail needs.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/547">see details</a></li>

Considering that part of Mailpile's mission is to make it easy for people to self-host and remove their private data from the corporate clouds, it is vitally important that we take steps to ensure this valuable data does not get lost due hardware malfunction, software bugs or human error. Mailpile needs to help people make secure backups of their mail, whether to removable physical media or to remote online storage.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/811">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="8" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="0" data-issue="1131"><h6 class="title">Make it easy to send e-mail over the Tor network instead of SMTP</h6> <span class="summary">When an e-mail is sent, generally it is relayed from mail server to mail server in multiple hops. At each step, the people operating the servers have access to information about senders, recipients, IP addresses, the subject of the message and various other metadata - even if the body of the mail is PGP encrypted. In order to avoid this privacy leak, we should make it possible for Mailpile users to send each other mail directly over the Tor network. This eliminates the middle-men and may also improve the user experience, since when e-mail is delivered directly there is no longer any doubt as to whether it has been delivered or not: no more uncertainty as to whether it is stuck half-way on some intermediate mail server somewhere, perhaps wrongly blocked as spam.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1131">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="9" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="0" data-issue="1124"><h6 class="title">Make it possible to create custom themes for Mailpile</h6> <span class="summary">It would be nice if web developers and designers could customize the look and feel of Mailpile. This will allow Mailpile to appeal to a broader audience and involve more design-minded people in the project. E-mail is such a large part of people's lives, that it is important that people feel comfortable and at ease in their mail client. It should be beautiful, as well as functional. In addition, there are certain communities with special needs that are best addressed with custom designs, whether for branding reasons, to foster a sense of community or to alleviate a disability.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1124">see details</a></li>
