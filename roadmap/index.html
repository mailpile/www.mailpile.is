This is particularly useful for managing mailing lists. The web interface needs to expose this functionality.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/998">see details</a></li>

This should be fixed.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1004">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-stretch label-tasks" data-rank="4" data-state="open" data-labels="stretch, tasks" data-comments="0" data-issue="1001"><h6 class="title">Implement IMAP IDLE support</h6> <span class="summary">IMAP IDLE provides a mechanism whereby the remote mail server can notify Mailpile that a new message has arrived, as soon as it is available. If Mailpile's IMAP mail sources supported this feature, then IMAP users would experience almost immediate delivery of mail.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1001">see details</a></li>

However, we are currently lacking a Mail Source implementation to take care of importing, discovering new mail and keeping Mailpile up to date as time passes.

         <li class="issue state-open label-tasks" data-rank="6" data-state="open" data-labels="tasks" data-comments="1" data-issue="994"><h6 class="title">Implement POP3 mail sources</h6> <span class="summary">POP3 is the older standard for downloading e-mail from a mail server, predating even IMAP. For users who just want to download all their mail and do not wish to keep a remote server up to date, this is still the most efficient option. We should implement it.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/994">see details</a></li>

This should allow us to, by default, offer the highest level of security that doesn't become a nuisance during everyday use.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/487">see details</a></li>

We should expose this feature in the app's user interface so people can use it.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1003">see details</a></li>

This may also be a potential source of revenue for the project and a way to fund ongoing development, depending on what sort of agreements are made.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1125">see details</a></li>

Mailpile should work with these projects both on technical and potentially business fronts, as their goals are strongly aligned with ours and the technology complementary.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1126">see details</a></li>

Although Mailpile's built-in spam filter provides a degree of protection against these threats, further steps are necessary, many of which are outlined in our security roadmap.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1132">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="4" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="0" data-issue="1130"><h6 class="title">Improve end-user documentation</h6> <span class="summary">There is a large amount of work that should be done in terms of explaining how Mailpile and it's many components work. This covers everything from context-sensitive hints within the app itself, to long-form manuals, to video tutorials, to the website presenting Mailpile to the world. In addition, the most critical parts of the end-user documentation will need to be translated to multiple languages. The core team will not be able to do all of this work ourselves, but we need to be sure infrastructure is in place to work with our community on this important task and it might be worth spending a portion of our budget on hiring tech writers, editors or translators.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1130">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="5" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="4" data-issue="820"><h6 class="title">Make Mailpile useful in shared-hosting and multiuser environments</h6> <span class="summary">Mailpile is currently a personal webmail client, which only handles e-mail for one person. The project should be expanded so Mailpile can be used in shared-hosting and multiuser environments, such as small to medium businesses and organizations. This will further our mission to bring user-friendly encryption to a wider audience, and make the project more sustainable as larger organizations become motivated to contribute resources to the development and upkeep of Mailpile.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/820">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="6" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="1" data-issue="547"><h6 class="title">Make it easy for 3rd parties to develop plugins for Mailpile</h6> <span class="summary">Plugins make it possible for 3rd party developers to contribute features and improvements to Mailpile, without needing to coordinate or seek permission. This is an important part of making Mailpile less dependent on the core team in the long-run, while making it easy for our wider community to add features that are tailored to their specific e-mail needs.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/547">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="7" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="1" data-issue="811"><h6 class="title">Make it easy to backup and restore e-mail, contacts, settings and metadata</h6> <span class="summary">People's e-mail contains large amounts of valuable personal information. Considering that part of Mailpile's mission is to make it easy for people to self-host and remove their private data from the corporate clouds, it is vitally important that we take steps to ensure this valuable data does not get lost due hardware malfunction, software bugs or human error. Mailpile needs to help people make secure backups of their mail, whether to removable physical media or to remote online storage.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/811">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="8" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="0" data-issue="1131"><h6 class="title">Make it easy to send e-mail over the Tor network instead of SMTP</h6> <span class="summary">When an e-mail is sent, generally it is relayed from mail server to mail server in multiple hops. At each step, the people operating the servers have access to information about senders, recipients, IP addresses, the subject of the message and various other metadata - even if the body of the mail is PGP encrypted. In order to avoid this privacy leak, we should make it possible for Mailpile users to send each other mail directly over the Tor network. This eliminates the middle-men and may also improve the user experience, since when e-mail is delivered directly there is no longer any doubt as to whether it has been delivered or not: no more uncertainty as to whether it is stuck half-way on some intermediate mail server somewhere, perhaps wrongly blocked as spam.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1131">see details</a></li>
         <li class="issue state-open label-high_level_goals" data-rank="9" data-state="open" data-labels="high_level_goals" data-comments="0" data-issue="1124"><h6 class="title">Make it possible to create custom themes for Mailpile</h6> <span class="summary">It would be nice if web developers and designers could customize the look and feel of Mailpile. This will allow Mailpile to appeal to a broader audience and involve more design-minded people in the project. E-mail is such a large part of people's lives, that it is important that people feel comfortable and at ease in their mail client. It should be beautiful, as well as functional. In addition, there are certain communities with special needs that are best addressed with custom designs, whether for branding reasons, to foster a sense of community or to alleviate a disability.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1124">see details</a></li>

This is a tried and tested implementation of PGP, but it is slowly becoming obsolete. In particular, we need to upgrade to GnuPG 2.1 in order to allow Mailpile users to take advantage of Elliptic Curve Cryptograpy which will be a requirement in order to exchange secure messages with users of Google's End-to-End encrypted e-mail solution.</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/1133">see details</a></li>

In order to stay current with the state of the art and reap the benefits of ongoing developments, Mailpile should upgrade to Python 3.3 (or newer).</span> <a class="more" href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/issues/160">see details</a></li>
