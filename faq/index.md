<li class="faq-section-title"><a class="anchor" id="wha"></a><h2>What Is Mailpile?</h2></li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">What is Mailpile?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Mailpile is software, an e-mail client. It runs on your desktop or laptop computer and you interact with it by using your web browser. The goal of Mailpile is to allow people to send e-mail in a more secure and private manner than before.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-2"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Where does Mailpile store my mail?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>We recommend you let Mailpile download your e-mail and store it on your computer. This allows you to read and write mail even if your Internet connection is not working, and gives you the option of deleting the mail from the server which in turn improves your privacy.</p>
<p>Mailpile stores mail it has downloaded in the Mailpile data folder, the precise location of which depends a bit on your operating system. It's easy to find from within the app though.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Then how do I access it when my computer is turned off?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>You don't! :-)</p>
<p>This is actually a very basic privacy feature; when your computer is switched off you can rest assured that nobody can access or read your mail.</p>
<p>If that does not appeal to you, you may prefer to leave Mailpile running on a computer that is always on. You can then access it over the network using your web browser.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Is Mailpile webmail like Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Mailpile is like these solutions, in that you use your web browser to interact with Mailpile, to read and write and organize your mail. The user interface Mailpile offers is in many ways quite similar to those.</p>
<p>However unlike most webmail solutions, Mailpile is meant to run on your own computer, so you have control over your data and your privacy. Mailpile also does not force you to change e-mail addresses, it works with the e-mail addresses you already have.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-5"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Where do I sign up for a Mailpile address?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Unlike the cloud-based webmail providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail etc.), Mailpile does not include its own <em>mail server</em>. This means you do not sign up for a "mailpile address", instead you use an e-mail addresses you already have.</p>
<p>As an example, you can use Mailpile with an existing GMail account, improving your privacy by configuring Mailpile to download the mail and then delete it from Google's servers.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-6"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">If I use my old e-mail, won't my mail still go through the old servers and be kept there indefinitely?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Yes, your mail will still follow the same path through the network as before.</p>
<p>However, if you download and delete your mail, it will most likely get purged from the server sooner or later - unless your e-mail provider is really out to get you! Exactly how long this takes can be difficult to predict, in particular since most well-run mail providers keep backups of your mail.</p>
<p>Backups do not invalidate the approach though. Even if the mail remains on a backup tape in a vault somewhere, a hacker who breaks in to your account will not be able to access all your old messages. Leaving aside the question of whether our e-mail providers are trustworthy or not, we all have friends and family whose curiosity may get the better of them, and computer criminals frequently target perfect strangers.</p>
<p>Nothing is perfect, but deleting mail from the server really does improve privacy for most people. And Mailpile will help you improve it even further by making it easy to encrypt your mail.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-7"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How much does Mailpile cost?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Mailpile is free of charge, you just download it and use it. It is also free of advertisements. Development is supported by voluntary donations from our community, from people like yourself who want a more secure and privacy friendly solution for e-mail.</p>
<p>To make a contribution, please visit <a href="https://www.mailpile.is/donate/">our donation page</a>!</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-8"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">I am a techie, can I fix bugs or add features to Mailpile?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Yes, Mailpile is 100% Free, Open Source Software. You can find the source code online and make any changes you please <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile">on Github</a>. We happily accept pull requests!</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="wha-9"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">If anyone can view the code &amp; change Mailpile, doesn't that make it less secure?</h3> <span class="faq-section">wha</span>
<p>Quite the opposite, Open Source facilitates peer review and quality engineering.</p>
<p>If the entire community of security professionals can examine how Mailpile works under the hood, they can and will help us find and fix problems quicker than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>Many professionals are of the opinion that security tools which keep their inner workings hidden from sight, are in fact less trustworthy because they could easily hide backdoors or deliberate vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has an interesting article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">"Security through Obscurity"</a> which discusses these philosophical issues in more depth.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://community.mailpile.is/">community discourse</a>, has <a href="https://community.mailpile.is/c/support">a support category</a>. Please feel free to ask questions there or volunteer your time to help others.</p>
<p>You can also use the forum to post tips and tricks, success stories, or discuss potential new features.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="how-2"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">I am a developer, how can I help?</h3> <span class="faq-section">how</span>
<p>Take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile">Github page</a>, we have a very long list of open issues.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="how-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">I am not a techie, how can I help?</h3> <span class="faq-section">how</span>
<p>You can spread the word about the awesomeness of Mailpile! </p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.mailpile.is/donate/">give us lots of money</a>! Or just a little bit, it all helps.</p>
<p>When we release new versions of the software (there have been a few Alpha and Beta releases already), it is useful for us to get feedback on what works well and what does not. However, note that <em>at the moment</em> we have literally hundreds of outstanding issues and are a bit swamped. As we make progress and fix the obvious things, getting reports about edge cases or things we haven't yet encountered will become more and more important.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="how-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Do you accept Bitcoin?</h3> <span class="faq-section">how</span>
<p>Yes. If you don't want to be anonymous you'll have to get in touch to let us know who to thank!</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-section-title"><a class="anchor" id="fea"></a><h2>Feature Requests</h2></li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Can Mailpile filter incoming messages to specific folders?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Mailpile uses Tags instead of folders. They function similarly, except a single message can have many different tags applied.</p>
<p>Filters can be defined which apply tags to incoming mail automatically.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-2"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Can Mailpile synchronize contact information with an external contact manager like Google contacts?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Not yet.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will there be POP, IMAP and SMTP support?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Yes!</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will there be an app for Android?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Not right away, no. But hopefully some day.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-5"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will there be an app for iPhone / iPad?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Not right away, no. But hopefully some day.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-6"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">For the Linux / Unix geeks, will there be a command line interface?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>Mailpile has a text-based interface which can be used in a terminal, in addition to the web-based user interface. There is also support for automation and scripting, but it is mostly at the Python level, not in the shell.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="fea-7"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">What about backups?</h3> <span class="faq-section">fea</span>
<p>This is not fully decided, but we do recognize that if users are to download their mail from the cloud and entrust it to Mailpile, then Mailpile will need to help make sure backups are in place and kept up to date.</p>
<p>We are considering ideas such as encrypting data and re-uploading to IMAP servers in order to implement secure off-site backups, as well as prompting the user to make backups by hand to USB, external media or even paper in some cases.</p>

<li class="faq-section-title"><a class="anchor" id="tec"></a><h2>Technical Questions</h2></li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile run on Windows 8.1, macOS, Linux etc. etc.?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Mailpile 1.0 should run on Linux, macOS and modern versions of Windows.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-2"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will mail sent from Mailpile be compatible with other e-mail clients?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Yes! We are compliant with all the appropriate internet and e-mail standards.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Can Mailpile import from Thunderbird, Outlook, Mac Mail, Eudora, etc...?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>We already support importing data from various common formats and aim to try and support all the popular formats over time.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile protect me from spam? Illegal content? Viruses?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Mailpile's spam filter will stop most such problems from reaching your inbox. However, no spam filter is perfect and we cannot guarantee you will never see unwanted or unpleasant e-mails.</p>
<p>In either case, we recommend using an up-to-date anti-virus solution and keeping your operating system and web browser fully up to date with the latest security updates.</p>
<p>Please also see our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a> for more details on how we plan to deal with malicious content in the future.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-5"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile run on Raspberry Pi?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Yes, most certainly. Mailpile runs on most Linux systems.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-6"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile work on PowerPC? ARM? Intel?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>You won't have any problems. Mailpile is written in Python, so it's very portable.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-7"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile support multiple email accounts?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Yes, you can use more than one e-mail account at once with Mailpile, both to receive mail and send.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="tec-8"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">I run a server! Can I can use Mailpile to give my users webmail access?</h3> <span class="faq-section">tec</span>
<p>Note that Mailpile is primarily written as a personal application, it is not designed for large multi-user installations.</p>
<p>That said, this should become possible for small groups quite soon after our 1.0 release. Mostly we will need to document the recommended setup procedure.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-section-title"><a class="anchor" id="int"></a><h2>Interface & Usability Design</h2></li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Do you have any plans to implement threaded conversations? Like GMail?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>Mailpile's default conversation view is very similar to that of GMail, with messages grouped together in chronological order.</p>
<p>Other threading strategies might be added later.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-2"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How will Mailpile exist well in both the Windows and the Mac worlds?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>Mailpile runs inside a web browser using HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the user interface. This provides an experience which is both familiar and very similar no matter what operating system they use.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Does Mailpile make PGP encryption simple?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>Yes! That is our goal at any rate. :-)</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile inform users if an e-mail they received was encrypted or not?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>Yes. Messages are annotated with icons illustrating both encryption state and whether a message was signed or not. More detailed context-appropriate explanations are available in tooltips.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-5"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will the composer make it easy to choose whether I want to encrypt or not?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>Yes, we have a put a lot of time into thinking about and designing this to be intuitive.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="int-6"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How hard will it be to install Mailpile?</h3> <span class="faq-section">int</span>
<p>It should simply be a double-click to launch an installer on Windows, or dragging an app to the Applications folder on the Mac.</p>
<p>On Linux we hope to provide native packages for most of the popular distributions.</p>

<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Is Mailpile an encrypted e-mail service?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Mailpile is not an e-mail service, it is software - an e-mail client - that supports strong encryption.</p>
</li>

<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-3"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Can you please support <em>insert-some-random-encryption-scheme</em></h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Yeah, we'll get right to that - after we get the standard, widely adopted protocols supported robustly... ;-)</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-4"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile be able to send messages that expire or self destruct?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>No, that is impossible.</p>
<p>You can't un-tell somebody something. You can ask them nicely to delete the message, but if they refuse, you can't make them. Sorry! The only way to do that is to not send the message in the first place.</p>
<p>(OK, so maybe it's not completely impossible. If you control their computer, you can <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/oct/22/amazon-wipes-customers-kindle-deletes-account">make their computer delete things without their consent</a>. But that's not very polite. And besides, Mailpile is an e-mail program, not an evil hacking tool from a James Bond film.)</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-5"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How will you prevent governments from accessing your user database?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Simple: We will not have a user database.</p>
<p>We do not have any server infrastructure that contains user information. Users install the Mailpile client on their own computers. We do not track people that want to use Mailpile.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-6"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Would it possible to add support for one-time passwords?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Yes. This may not happen until after 1.0, but it is an important feature Mailpile needs to have.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-7"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How secure is Mailpile's internal database and configuration?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Mailpile will by default encrypt all configuration data, contacts and the search index. It may also encrypt downloaded e-mail, depending on user preferences.</p>
<p>Encryption is either provided by the GnuPG program, or OpenSSL's AES support.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-8"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How are attachments stored? Are they encrypted, too?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Email attachments are stored wherever your e-mail is stored.</p>
<p>If that's secure, the attachments are secure. We will provide methods to secure your e-mail, although we recommend that you use full disk encryption!</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-9"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will search work with encrypted messages?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Mailpile will decrypt incoming e-mail on the fly and update the search index. The message is then stored to disk in its original encrypted form. The search index itself is strongly encrypted.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-10"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">What are Mailpile's weak points, security-wise? What can be done?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Mailpile is an e-mail client and interoperates with existing standards. These standards are often lacking, in particular when it comes to protecting various types of metadata, anonymity or privacy.</p>
<p>For example, the OpenPGP encryption standard does not encrypt message headers, so the Subject, From and To lines are sent unencrypted. Mailpile is taking part in efforts to improve these standards.</p>
<p>Another example is the PGP web of trust. The web of trust is meant to help verify the authenticity of a given encryption key. Unfortunately, the web of trust relies on people publishing, in public, details about who they know and who they communicate with (in the form of signatures on keys uploaded to key servers). This is a very basic privacy problem; even Facebook recognize the need to let people restrict access to their friends list! As a result, Mailpile does not encourage use of the web of trust and relies instead on a "trust on first use" scheme to discover and authenticate keys.</p>
<p>The most fundamental problem of course, is that you cannot send encrypted e-mail to someone who does not themselves have an encryption key and software capable of reading and writing encrypted mail. Mailpile itself is an attempt to remedy this, by making an encryption capable e-mail client that people can easily install and use.</p>
<p>For all the nitty-gritty details about Mailpile's security and its limitations, please consult our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a>.</p>

<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-11"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile work with Tor and .onion domains?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>If you mean sending mail to .onion domains: probably! Check out our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/SMTorP">SMTorP</a> draft proposal.</p>
<p>If you mean accessing Mailpile's web interface as a Tor hidden service: Yes!
We plan to provide support for that.</p>
<p>Mailpile will also use Tor to download information anonymously from key servers and web services like Gravatar, and potentially to send or download e-mail, when that can be done without messages getting misclassified as spam or exit nodes snooping on sensitive traffic.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a> for more details.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-12"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">How does Mailpile compare with something like Hushmail? Protonmail? Whiteout?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Usually, these solutions store your e-mail data on their servers.</p>
<p>Usually, they also provide a web interface to read and write mail, possibly using Javascript-based cryptography to support claims that they cannot read your mail since all the encryption and decryption takes place in your browser, on your computer.</p>
<p>This may be better than nothing, but it can also provide a false sense of security: if the same entity is responsible for storing the e-mail and providing you with encryption software, then all they need to do to read your mail is modify the code so it goes behind your back and sends them a copy of the keys. This is not a theretical problem, it <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/11/encrypted-e-mai/">has already happened</a> and if your adversary is a government you would do well to steer clear of these solutions.</p>
<p>Mailpile is just software. The authors of Mailpile will never have a copy of your e-mail (or encryption keys), unless you mail them to us! Furthermore, we are committed to distributing Mailpile in ways that make it hard or impossible for us target individual users for "Trojan horses".</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-13"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Does everyone need to be using Mailpile to be truly secure?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Of course! World domination, here we come!</p>
<p>But seriously, no. Mailpile implements public standards and you can exchange mail with any other mail client that supports those same standards. When we feel the standards fall short, we will use open processes to propose improvements and work with authors of other e-mail systems to make sure our respective users can communicate as easily and securely as possible.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-14"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Does Mailpile solve secure public key distribution?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Mailpile will by default use an ad-hoc, opportunistic model of key distribution and discovery.</p>
<p>Public keys will be attached to outgoing e-mail and Mailpile will when necessary search the local mail store for key material before reaching out to key servers or other external services. The trust model will be "TOFU/C", Trust on First Use/Contact, augmented by historic analysis of observed behavior, with key servers and traditional fingerprint verification as fallback strategies.</p>

</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-15"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will you be storing my private key on your mail server?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>No. We do not operate mail servers and we do not store users' private keys.</p>
<p>You install Mailpile on your own computer, which keeps your key nice, safe, and under your control.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-16"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Do plan to implement RFC6698 DANE and move towards CA free authentication?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Not for version 1.0, but hopefully later!</p>
<p>Please consult our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-17"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will you implement Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>There is no accepted standard for how to do this for e-mail itself, so that is not on our initial roadmap.</p>
<p>However, Mailpile will certainly prefer ciphers which offer PFS whenever making a TLS connection for sending or receiving mail (IMAP, POP3, SMTP, etc.).</p>
<p>Please consult our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a> for details.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-18"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will you implement STARTTLS?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Yes.</p>
</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-19"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will you hide the client's IP address when sending e-mail?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Perhaps.</p>
<p>We are considering using Tor for this sort of thing, and hopefully the community will provide plugins implementing support for MixMasters and anonymous mail.</p>
<p>However, we are not committed to this plan, due to concerns that it would increase the risk that legitimate mail gets classified as Spam. There is little point sending mail securely if that prevents it from being delivered at all!</p>

</li>
<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="enc-20"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Will Mailpile support sending S/MIME emails?</h3> <span class="faq-section">enc</span>
<p>Yes, but not right away.</p>
<p>Once OpenPGP and PGP/MIME work well, both from the user experience and technical points of view, we will look into adding other protocols, with S/MIME very near the top of the list.</p>
<p>Please consult our <a href="https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Security-roadmap">Security Roadmap</a> for details.</p>

<li class="faq-item"><a class="anchor" id="bra-1"></a> <h3 class="faq-title">Does Mailpile allow me to customize my install with a company logo, colors, font?</h3> <span class="faq-section">bra</span>
<p>The code is open, so if your people know how, then this can be done. Mailpile is Open Source, so the license explicitly permits such modifications.</p>
<p>We are also working on native support for themes and skins, but those features will not be ready until well after the 1.0 has launched.</p>
